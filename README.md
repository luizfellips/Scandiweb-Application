Live app:

- My code and overall folder structure from development is different in the production, as I had to adapt to the webhost's standards.
- Both folders are available in this repo.

Along the code, I may have commented some parts which refer to different approaches(which might be more complex) to solve the same problem, given the restriction of if/else and switch/case.
I hope this can help evaluate my programming skills, my will to learn and grow, and if I'm fit enough to join your team.
